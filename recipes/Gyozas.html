            <p id="description">Gyozas are steamed and grilled Japanese dumplings that are gaining ground in our gastronomy. Until a few years ago we
                did not know anything about dim sum, we could say that they are the Japanese "tapas" since there are different types
                with gyozas, baozi, dumplings or delicious fried wontons (among many other types).</p>

                        <li>Mix the minced meat with the spices, fresh herbs, soy and perrin's sauce. Season with salt and reserve in
                                the fridge.</li>
                        <li>Sauté it over medium heat until very well browned. Add the minced garlic and brown it. We mix it together
                                with the minced meat and move well to integrate all the flavors.</li>
                        <li>Let cool so you can work more easily.</li>
                        <li>Remove the outer leaves and finely chop the inner ones.</li>
                        <li>Cook in boiling salted water for 5 ́. If we are not going to use them at the moment, we refresh in water
                            with salt and drain very well.</li>
                        <li>Heat a frying pan with oil and brown the finely chopped garlic together with the ginger.</li>
                        <li>When they take on color, we add the cabbage and sauté it for a few seconds over high heat. </li>
                        <li>Add the soybeans and cook a few more seconds. We booked.</li>
                        <li>Once cold, mix the ear and pork stuffing with the well-drained cabbage.</li>
                        <li>We fill the wafer with it.</li>
                        <li>We paint the edge with water and close it in the shape of a crescent making some folds
                            with our fingers.</li>
                        <li>We booked.</li>

                    <p style="margin-left: 50px;">To cook the Gyoza:</p>
                    <ol>

                        <li>When it is golden, add 1/3 of the capacity of a glass of water and cover. Lower the heat to medium and cook
                            them for 5 ́always with the container covered.</li>
