            <p id="descripcion">Gyozas are steamed and grilled Japanese dumplings that are gaining ground in our gastronomy. Until a few years ago we
                did not know anything about dim sum, we could say that they are the Japanese "tapas" since there are different types
                with gyozas, baozi, dumplings or delicious fried wontons (among many other types).</p>
