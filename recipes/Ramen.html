    <img src="../images/Ramen.jpg"><br>

    <p>With the busy spring season here, quick and easy one pot meals are a lifesaver during the busy week. My family is
        crazy about any dish with teriyaki sauce so we are always trying to incorporate those sweet and savory
        Asian-inspired flavors into any meal we can</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>For the broth:</p>
        <li>1 rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li> 4 cups gluten free chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups of water</li>
        <li>Kosher or fine sea salt and pepper to Taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>10 ounces gluten-free ramen noodles</li>
        <p>Toppings:</p>

            stirring, for about 1 minute or until fragrant. Add the chicken broth, water, San-J Tamari Soy Sauce, and
            mirin along with the chicken bones and skin. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 20-30
            minutes. Strain the broth, season to taste with salt and pepper and keep warm.</li>
